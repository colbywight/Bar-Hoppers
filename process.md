### Background and Motivation
  Our motivation for this project was correlating education and funding of schools. My personal research interest is the improvement of education through technology. Thus, the first steps in this process is knowing where the system lacks and can be improved. Although financial data and influence is not directly related to technology helping students rate of improvement. However, using technology to improve funding in education (namely to reduce funding) yet improve performance is an appeal to start using more technology in education if it does in fact improve areas such as test scores while requiring less funding, especially over time. We believe the education of students will influence how our society progresses and are interested in improving the system by correlating influential factors. 

### Project Objectives
Our main objective is to create a visualization that shows both student success rate and school funding in a way that users can create with their own hypotheses on why there is or isn't a correlation between the two throughout different areas across the US. It might also be beneficial to further break down student success by different subjects to see how funding is tied to individual subjects. 

Specific questions that could be answered with this vis:  
What states and areas of the united states perform best academically?  
How is school funding correlated with academic performance across the united states?  
Within an individual state what subjects are students best at?  

There are multiple benefits that could come from this work. The most obvious is to see what the correlation is between funding and academic success. We hope this visualization will spark other questions and give inspiration to other ideas on what other factors might be correlated with academic success.  We could also learn what subjects students from different locations excel at to better understand how we can all contribute to the betterment of our society in different ways. 

### Data
Our data will come from a few sources. Namely data providing test scores of students for different states. Data providing financial information of schools by states. And data providing financial information of households.
